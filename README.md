Video Wall little app for Windows Multi-Monitor Synced Playback
This is live and running in a museum video wall(kind of setup). The goal was to play the videos in order but in different monitors. Tools for this exist but this was written since the tools were all a little too needy in terms of maintenance and this is quite lightweight and easy to run all the time. This was made to run 8 videos moving across monitors with a video running on loop while the necessary input to start the show was given.
